#comments for question: do the bar plot and scatter plot tell different stories:
##Yes! The scatter plot is able to illustrate the variability of the data for a given 
##region. For example, in the bar plot, it could be easy to interpret that all regions 
##have uniform (or alike) data points. However, the scatter plot reveals that that is not 
##the case and although they may have similar means, the distribution of this data is very spread
